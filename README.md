### Part 1
- a.The code is included above, The codes find reoccurring motifs in graphs.
The code will output all motifs witch are connected sub-graphs, of size n.   
- b.The output of run when n = 4 is attached in text file.<br /> 
- c+d.The answer is that the maximun n for which the code runs in under 1 hour is n=4.
And n=5 will finish in under 2 hours, n=6 didn't complete under 8 hours So the final answer to both 4 and 8 is n =5.
The code is also included above but we wouldn't recommed to run the code because the run will take more then 8 hours.

### Part 2
The code is included above. The code gets as input number n and graph contained n verticals.
The program output all sub-graphs of size ùëõ and
count how many instances appear of each motif.<br /> 
The output of run with input the example that was given in the exercise included above.
